//! Traits and types for custom telemetry consumers and middleware.
//!
//! Unfortunately `tracing` library lacks a number of capabilities:
//!
//! 1) It provides efficient out of the box way to store arbitrary data associated with
//!    spans (`extensions`), but lacks a thread safe storage for events aka log data. And we
//!    need both for our telemetry data pipeline.
//! 2) Tracing doesn't allow passing arbitrary structured data to span/log facades,
//!    unless it is one of primitive types.
//! 3) Tracing per-layer filtering API doesn't provide access to span/log data.
//! 4) Tracing allows runtime reloading of layers, but doesn't work if they are filtered:
//!    https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/1629 - we need this for out tests.
//!
//! We solve (1), (3), and (4) by implementing our own layer-like, filter
//! and middle-ware traits and types that are called from our single tracing layer
//! - `DataLayer`. They have less general purpose API than `tracing-subscriber` layers,
//!   but provide all the capabilities we need, and in a more performant way to boot.
